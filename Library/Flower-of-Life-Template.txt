# THE DIVINE PYMANDER OF HERMES TRISMEGISTUS
 
## INTRODUCTION
 
The Divine Pymander is one of the most profound and influential texts of the Hermetic tradition, attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, the legendary Egyptian sage. This ancient work presents a dialogue between Hermes and Pymander (the "Mind of Sovereignty"), revealing fundamental truths about the nature of reality, consciousness, and spiritual transformation.
 
The text forms part of the Corpus Hermeticum, a collection of wisdom texts that blend Egyptian theology, Greek philosophy, and early alchemical concepts. These teachings have influenced Western esoteric thought for centuries, shaping traditions from Neoplatonism to Renaissance magic and modern occultism.
 
## THE FIRST BOOK: POEMANDRES, THE SHEPHERD OF MEN
 
1. Once, when I had begun to think about the things that are, and my thoughts had soared high aloft, while my bodily senses had been restrained by sleepâ€”yet not such sleep as that of men weighed down by fullness of food or by bodily wearinessâ€”methought there came to me a Being of vast and boundless magnitude, who called me by my name, and said to me, "What do you wish to hear and see, and to learn and know by thought?"
 
2. "Who are you?" I said.
 
3. "I am Poemandres," he said, "the Mind of Sovereignty; I know what you wish, and I am with you everywhere."
 
4. I said, "I wish to learn the things that are, and understand their nature, and know God. These are the things," I said, "that I desire to hear."
 
5. He answered me, "Keep in mind all that you wish to learn, and I will teach you."
 
6. When he had thus spoken, forthwith all things changed in aspect before me, and were opened out in a moment. And I beheld a boundless view: all was changed into light, a mild and joyous light; and I marveled when I saw it.
 
7. And in a little while, there had come to be in one part a downward-tending darkness, terrible and grim, and methought it was like unto a snake. And thereafter I saw the darkness changing into a watery substance, which was unspeakably tossed about, and gave forth smoke as from fire; and I heard it making an indescribable sound of lamentation.
 
8. But from the Light there came forth a holy Word, which took its stand upon the watery substance; and methought this Word was the voice of the Light. And Poemandres said to me, "Do you understand what is the meaning of what you have seen?"
 
9. "I shall come to know," said I.
 
10. "That Light," he said, "is I, even Mind, the first God, who was before the watery substance which appeared out of the darkness; and the Word which came forth from the Light is son of God."
 
11. "How so?" said I.
 
12. "Learn my meaning," said he, "by looking at what you yourself have in you; for in you too, the word is son, and the mind is father of the word. They are not separate one from the other; for life is the union of word and mind."
 
13. "I thank you," said I.
 
14. "Now fix your thought upon the Light," he said, "and learn to know it."
 
15. When he had thus spoken, he gazed long upon me, eye to eye, so that I trembled at his aspect. And when I raised my head again, I saw in my mind that the Light consisted of innumerable Powers, and had come to be an ordered world, but a world without bounds. This I perceived in thought, seeing it by reason of the words which Poemandres had spoken to me.
 
## ON THE NATURE OF THE COSMOS AND THE SOUL
 
16. As I was in amazement, he spoke again to me: "You have seen in your mind the archetypal form, which is prior to the beginning of things and is limitless."
 
17. "But tell me," I asked, "whence came the elements of nature?"
 
18. He answered: "They issued from God's Purpose, which beheld that beauteous world, and copied it. The watery substance, having received the Word, was fashioned into an ordered world, the elements being separated out from it."
 
19. "And what then?" I asked.
 
20. "God, the Mind, being male and female both, and life and light, brought forth by his Word another Mind, the Craftsman, who, being god of fire and breath, fashioned Rulers, seven in number, who encompass with their orbits the world perceived by sense; and their government is called Destiny."
 
21. "Forthwith the Word of God leapt up from the downward-tending elements of nature to the pure body of the heaven, and was united to the Mind-Craftsman; for the Word was of one substance with that Mind. And the downward-tending elements of nature were left devoid of reason, so as to be mere matter."
 
## ON THE ASCENT OF THE SOUL
 
22. "But Mind the Craftsman, together with the Word, encompassing the spheres, and causing them to revolve with rushing motion, set his creations circling round, and let them revolve from an indefinite beginning to a limitless end; for the circulation begins where it ends."
 
23. "And the rotation of the spheres, as Mind willed, produced out of the downward-tending elements living creatures without reason; for those elements had not the Word in them. The air brought forth winged things; the water, things that swim; and earth and water were separated one from the other, as Mind willed. And earth brought forth from herself the living creatures which she had within her, four-footed beasts and reptiles, wild animals and tame."
 
24. "But the Father of all things, who is Life and Light, gave birth to Man, a Being like to Himself. And He took delight in Man, as being His own offspring; for Man was very goodly to look on, bearing the likeness of his Father. With good reason then did God take delight in Man; for it was God's own form that God took delight in."
 
## THE DESCENT AND REDEMPTION OF MAN
 
25. "And God delivered over to Man all things that had been made. And Man took station in the Maker's sphere, and observed the things made by his brother, who was set over the region of fire; and having observed the Maker's creation in the region of fire, he willed to make things for his own part also; and his Father gave permission, having in himself all the workings of the Administrators."
 
26. "And the Administrators took delight in him, and each of them gave him a share of his own nature. And having learnt to know the being of the Administrators, and received a share of their nature, he willed to break through the bounding circle of their orbits; and he looked down through the structure of the heavens, having broken through the sphere, and showed to downward-tending Nature the beautiful form of God."
 
27. "And Nature, seeing the beauty of the form of God, smiled with insatiate love of Man, showing the reflection of that most beautiful form in the water, and its shadow on the earth. And he, seeing this form, a form like to his own, in earth and water, loved it, and willed to dwell there. And the deed followed close on the design; and he took up his abode in matter devoid of reason."
 
28. "And Nature, when she had got him with whom she was in love, wrapped him in her clasp, and they were mingled in one; for they were in love with one another. And that is why man, unlike all other living creatures upon earth, is twofold; mortal by reason of his body, immortal by reason of the Man of eternal substance. He is immortal, and has all things in his power; yet he suffers the lot of a mortal, being subject to Destiny."
 
## THE PATH TO ENLIGHTENMENT
 
29. "He who has understood himself advances towards God; but he who has been led by bodily desire runs wandering through the darkness of the world of sense, suffering the lot of death."
 
30. "What is the sin so great," I asked, "that those who are in ignorance are deprived of immortality?"
 
31. "It seems that you have not given heed to what you have heard," answered Poemandres; "did I not bid you think?"
 
32. "I am thinking, and I remember, and I thank you."
 
33. "If you have understood, tell me, why do they deserve death who are in death?"
 
34. "Because the source from which the body has its being is the grim darkness, from which came the watery substance, from which was constituted the body in the world of sense, the body from which death draws its water."
 
35. "You have understood rightly, my son. But tell me further, why is it that he who has understood himself advances towards God, as God's Word has declared?"
 
36. And I replied, "Because the Father of all things is constituted of light and life, and from him Man has sprung."
 
37. "You speak well," said he; "light and life is God, even the Father, from whom Man was born. If then you learn to know yourself as made of light and life, and that you came forth from these, you will return to life." Thus spoke Poemandres.
 
38. "But tell me more," I said, "how shall I come to life, O my Mind? For God says, 'Let the man who has mind in him recognize himself.'"
 
39. "Have not all men then mind?"
 
40. "Speak not so, my son," said he; "I, even Mind, am present with holy and good men and pure and merciful, men who live piously; and my presence becomes a help to them, and forthwith they gain knowledge of all things. And they propitiate the Father with loving affection, and give thanks to him, praising him and singing hymns to him, with hearts uplifted to him in filial love."
 
## CONCLUSION
 
41. "And now, O my son, I have told you all, that you may be silent before others, keeping the mystery to yourself. My son, be godly, and live a pure life. The first step to salvation is to know God; and that path have I shown to you today."
 
42. Having thus spoken to me, Poemandres mingled with the Powers. And I, having given thanks and blessing to the Father of all things, was freed from the Powers, Poemandres having instructed me concerning the nature of the All and the supreme Vision. And I began to proclaim to mankind the beauty of devotion and knowledge: "O people, men born of earth, who have given yourselves up to drunkenness and sleep and ignorance of God, be sober now, cease from your surfeit, cease to be glamoured by irrational sleep."
 
43. And when they heard me, they gathered round me. And I said, "Why, O men born of earth, have you given yourselves up to death, when you have power to partake of immortality? Repent, you who walk in error and have accepted ignorance as your companion. Be quit of that light which is darkness; partake of immortality, forsaking corruption."
 
44. And some of them mocked and turned away, having surrendered themselves to the path of death; but others, casting themselves at my feet, besought me to teach them. And I, raising them up, became a guide to my race, teaching them the wordsâ€”how and in what way they might be saved. And I sowed in them words of wisdom, and they were nourished with the ambrosial water. And when evening came and the sun's light began to disappear entirely, I bade them give thanks to God. And having completed their thanksgiving, they turned each to his own bed.
 
45. But I wrote in my heart Poemandres's benefaction, and having been filled with what I desired, I was exceedingly glad. For the sleep of my body became sobriety of soul, and the closing of my eyes became true vision, and my silence became pregnant with good, and the utterance of my word became good fruits. And all this befell me through receiving Mind, that is, Poemandres, the Word of Sovereignty; whereby I became divinely inspired, and came to the truth.
 
46. Therefore I give praise to God the Father with my whole soul and strength: "Holy is God the Father of all things; holy is God, whose will is accomplished by his own Powers; holy is God, who wills to be known, and is known by his own people; holy art thou, who by thy Word hast constituted all things that are; holy art thou, of whom all nature was born as image; holy art thou, whom nature has not formed; holy art thou, who art stronger than all dominion; holy art thou, who art greater than all preeminence; holy art thou, who art better than all praise. Accept pure offerings of speech from a soul and heart uplifted to thee, O thou who art not to be spoken of, not to be uttered, whom silence only can declare."
 
47. "I beseech thee, let me not fall from the knowledge that befits my nature; and give me strength, and fill with this grace those who are in ignorance, my brothers and thy sons. Therefore I believe in thee, and bear witness to thee, and depart in peace and trust to thy light and life. Blessed art thou, O Father; thy man would be sanctified with thee, even as thou hast given him power to sanctify others with thy word."

THE EMERALD TABLET OF HERMES TRISMEGISTUS
 
True, without falsehood, certain and most true.
 
That which is below is like that which is above, and that which is above is like that which is below, to accomplish the miracles of the one thing.
 
And as all things were from one, by the meditation of one, so from this one thing come all things by adaptation.
 
Its father is the Sun, its mother is the Moon, the Wind carried it in its belly, its nurse is the Earth.
 
It is the father of all works of wonder in the world.
 
Its power is complete if it be cast unto the Earth.
 
It will separate the element of Earth from that of Fire, the subtle from the gross, gently and with great sagacity.
 
It doth ascend from Earth to Heaven, and descend again to Earth, and receiveth the power of the superiors and of the inferiors.
 
So thou hast the glory of the whole world; therefore let all obscurity flee before thee.
 
This is the strong fortitude of all fortitude, overcoming every subtle and penetrating every solid thing.
 
So the world was created.
 
Hence are all wonderful adaptations, of which this is the manner.
 
Therefore am I called Hermes Trismegistus, having the three parts of the philosophy of the whole world.
 
That which I have said concerning the operation of the Sun is accomplished.

COMMENTARY ON THE EMERALD TABLET
 
The Emerald Tablet, also known as the Smaragdine Table or Tabula Smaragdina, is a compact and cryptic Hermetic text. It was highly regarded by European alchemists as the foundation of their art and its Hermetic tradition. The original source of the Emerald Tablet is unknown. Although Hermes Trismegistus is the author named in the text, its first known appearance is in a book written in Arabic between the sixth and eighth centuries. The text was first translated into Latin in the twelfth century.
 
Numerous translations and interpretations followed. The tablet text has also been translated and commented on by Isaac Newton.
 
The layers of meaning in the Emerald Tablet have been associated with the creation of the philosopher's stone, laboratory experimentation, phase transition, the alchemical magnum opus, the ancient, classical, element system, and the correspondence between macrocosm and microcosm.
 
In its most basic interpretation, the tablet outlines the hidden forces of nature and the universe, describing how the physical world came into being and humanity's role within it. It speaks to the unity of all things and the fundamental patterns that govern existence.
 
The phrase "as above, so below" encapsulates the principle of correspondence between the celestial and terrestrial realms, suggesting that the patterns and laws governing the cosmos are reflected in the earthly domain, and vice versa. This concept has been central to esoteric thought throughout history.
