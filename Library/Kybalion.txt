THE KYBALION
A Study of the Hermetic Philosophy of Ancient Egypt and Greece

THE SEVEN HERMETIC PRINCIPLES

1. THE PRINCIPLE OF MENTALISM
"The All is Mind; the Universe is Mental."

2. THE PRINCIPLE OF CORRESPONDENCE
"As above, so below; as below, so above."
This principle embodies the truth that there is always a correspondence between the laws and phenomena of the various planes of being and life.

3. THE PRINCIPLE OF VIBRATION
"Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates."

4. THE PRINCIPLE OF POLARITY
"Everything is dual; everything has poles; everything has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree; extremes meet; all truths are but half-truths; all paradoxes may be reconciled."

5. THE PRINCIPLE OF RHYTHM
"Everything flows, out and in; everything has its tides; all things rise and fall; the pendulum-swing manifests in everything; the measure of the swing to the right is the measure of the swing to the left; rhythm compensates."

6. THE PRINCIPLE OF CAUSE AND EFFECT
"Every cause has its effect; every effect has its cause; everything happens according to law; chance is but a name for law not recognized; there are many planes of causation, but nothing escapes the law."

7. THE PRINCIPLE OF GENDER
"Gender is in everything; everything has its masculine and feminine principles; gender manifests on all planes."
