                            When Leonardo died in 1519, he left Melzi all of his books, instruments, and most importantly, his manuscripts. Melzi understood the immense value of this inheritance - not just the monetary worth, but the intellectual treasure it represented. He spent the rest of his life organizing, preserving, and attempting to publish Leonardo's work. Without Melzi's devoted guardianship, most of Leonardo's notebooks would have been lost to history.

                            Melzi compiled the "Libro di Pittura" (Book of Painting) from Leonardo's scattered notes, creating the first systematic treatise on Leonardo's painting theories. After Melzi's death in 1570, the manuscripts were scattered, but his 50 years of careful preservation ensured their survival. He is the unsung hero who made Leonardo's posthumous reputation possible.

                    <div class="collaborator-description">
                        Gian Giacomo Caprotti, nicknamed "Salai" (Little Devil), entered Leonardo's household in 1490 as a 10-year-old boy and remained with him for over 25 years until Leonardo's death. Despite Leonardo's initial notes describing Salai as a thief, liar, and glutton, their relationship evolved into one of the most enduring partnerships in art history. Salai was model, student, companion, and perhaps Leonardo's greatest personal attachment.

                            Leonardo's relationship with Salai was complicated and profound. Early notebook entries show frustration with the boy's behavior, but later entries reveal deep affection. Leonardo gave Salai expensive clothes, supported his family, and even left him significant inheritance. Salai represented the human, emotional side of Leonardo's life - the master who could dissect corpses with scientific detachment but who loved this difficult, beautiful young man unconditionally.

                            Salai became a competent painter in his own right, often copying and interpreting Leonardo's works. He owned several Leonardo paintings, including possibly an early version of the Mona Lisa. His own works show Leonardo's influence but lack the master's innovative genius. After Leonardo's death, Salai returned to Milan where he continued painting until his death in 1524.

                    <div class="work-description">
                        Perhaps the most famous religious painting in history, The Last Supper captures the dramatic moment when Christ announces "One of you will betray me." Leonardo revolutionized religious art by focusing on the psychological drama rather than just the sacred narrative. Each apostle reacts differently to the shocking news, their gestures and expressions revealing their individual characters.

                            Leonardo used experimental oil tempera on dry wall instead of traditional fresco, allowing him to work slowly and make changes. He applied mathematical perspective to create depth, positioned Christ at the vanishing point, and used light symbolically. The composition's psychological complexity and technical innovation influenced Western art for centuries.

                        The world's most famous painting began as a portrait commission but became Leonardo's lifelong obsession. Lisa Gherardini's enigmatic smile, direct gaze, and the atmospheric landscape behind her created a new standard for portraiture. Leonardo never delivered the painting, carrying it with him throughout his final years and continuing to refine it.

                        This portrait of Cecilia Gallerani, mistress of Ludovico Sforza, showcases Leonardo's ability to capture both physical beauty and intellectual depth. The ermine (a symbol of purity and the Duke's emblem) adds layers of meaning to the composition. Cecilia's alert expression and the ermine's watchful gaze create a dialogue within the painting.

                        Leonardo's perfectionism often prevented him from completing works, but it also drove him to innovations that lesser artists wouldn't attempt. He reworked paintings for years, studied subjects obsessively, and refused to accept conventional solutions. His standards were impossibly high because he sought to capture divine perfection in earthly materials.

                    <div class="timeline-content">
                        Born on April 15 in the small town of Vinci, near Florence. Leonardo was the illegitimate son of Ser Piero da Vinci, a notary, and Caterina, a peasant woman. This humble beginning would shape his outsider perspective and drive for knowledge throughout his life. His grandfather Antonio recorded the precise time of his birth: "the third hour of the night," showing the family's attention to detail that Leonardo would inherit.

                    <div class="timeline-content">
                        At age 14, Leonardo entered the workshop of Andrea del Verrocchio in Florence, one of the most prestigious artistic workshops of the Renaissance. Here he learned painting, sculpture, and the mechanical arts. The workshop was a complete education center where art met engineering, mathematics met beauty. Verrocchio's workshop produced some of the era's greatest talents, and Leonardo quickly distinguished himself among the apprentices.

                    <div class="timeline-content">
                        Leonardo was accepted into the Guild of Saint Luke, the organization of artists and doctors of medicine in Florence. This marked his transition from apprentice to master craftsman. At just 20 years old, he was recognized as a professional artist, yet he chose to remain with Verrocchio for several more years, continuing to learn and contribute to major commissions.

                    <div class="timeline-content">
                        Leonardo moved to Milan to serve Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan. He presented himself not primarily as an artist, but as a military engineer and inventor. His famous letter to Ludovico lists ten military engineering capabilities and mentions his artistic skills almost as an afterthought. This period in Milan (1482-1499) would be one of his most productive, where he painted The Last Supper and filled thousands of notebook pages with inventions and observations.

                    <div class="timeline-content">
                        Leonardo painted his masterpiece "The Last Supper" on the wall of the refectory in the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan. Revolutionary in its composition and psychological depth, the painting captured the moment Christ announces his betrayal. Leonardo experimented with oil tempera on dry wall instead of traditional fresco, allowing him more time to work but making the painting more fragile. The work established him as one of the greatest painters of all time.

                        Leonardo began painting the Mona Lisa (La Gioconda) around 1503, working on it intermittently for the rest of his life. The portrait of Lisa Gherardini, wife of Florentine merchant Francesco del Giocondo, became the world's most famous painting. Leonardo's revolutionary techniques - sfumato (subtle gradations), atmospheric perspective, and the enigmatic smile - created a work that seems to transcend time itself. He carried this painting with him everywhere, never delivering it to the commissioner.

                        Returning to Milan under French rule, Leonardo deepened his anatomical studies, performing dissections and creating the most accurate anatomical drawings of his time. He studied the human heart, brain, and reproductive system with unprecedented detail. His anatomical notebooks reveal insights that wouldn't be rediscovered for centuries. During this period, he also worked on hydraulic engineering projects and continued his mechanical inventions.

                        Invited by King Francis I of France, Leonardo spent his final years at the Château du Clos Lucé near the royal residence of Amboise. The king honored him with the title "Premier Painter, Engineer and Architect to the King." Despite suffering a stroke that paralyzed his right hand, Leonardo continued working with his left hand and supervised the education of Francesco Melzi, his devoted pupil who would inherit his manuscripts. He died on May 2, 1519, at age 67, leaving behind over 13,000 pages of notes and sketches.

                        Francesco Melzi was more than a student to Leonardo - he was the chosen heir to his intellectual legacy. Born into nobility around 1491, Melzi joined Leonardo's household as a young man and remained with him for the rest of the master's life. Unlike other pupils who came and went, Melzi demonstrated not only artistic ability but also the scholarly temperament necessary to understand and preserve Leonardo's vast body of work.
